# hello-world
Hello everyone, my name is Ben Wood.  My hometown is Vernal, Utah, and in a series of events my wife and I moved back to Vernal in 2008, so my time zone is Mountain Standard Time, same as BYUI.  My wife and I have been married for 16 years.  We have four children, three boys and a girl, and their ages range from 12 to 4.

I'm pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Information Technology.  I got back into education through the Pathway program last year.  I have really enjoyed the mix of secular and religious education that BYUI offers.  I enjoy playing sports and spending time with my family, riding my road and mountain bicycles, running Ragnar relays, and the occasionally triathlon.  I have been employed with Dominion Energy as a Telecommunications Technician for the past 10 years.
